Here is all of the source code for the main parts of my website, you can simply drop these on some form of web server and run them pretty easily! Just like the Neobyte Network Website, i don't add web apps into the branch as that would be pointless! But i have attached the status Application, also known as Linux Dash into the branch as its a very simple Application to run (Just ensure you allow your web server Read and Write access to the Status Directory).

#Can i use it?
I don't see any reason why not! But just remember time and effort went into the creation so copying it and changing all the names isn't too cool! But if you want to base your own site off this then, go ahead! :)

#What do i need?
The site will run on any public facing or internal facing web server, such as Apache or Nginx, there should need to be any further configuration apart from checking that your web server is able to be overridden by HTA files!
